1,1,1,"Reimu Hakurei","Manipulation of Auras, High Intuition, Flight, Summoning Godly Powers","Mid-teens","Shrine maiden","Reimu Hakurei is one of the main characters of the Touhou Project series, having appeared in almost every game in the series. As the sole maiden of the Hakurei Shrine, she is commonly called upon (or calls it upon herself) to investigate strange occurrences throughout Gensokyo.In earlier games, Reimu's spiritual abilities were highly limited. (In Highly Responsive to Prayers, she was unable to directly harm enemies at all.) As time passed, however, she developed her abilities, becoming able to manipulate the Hakurei Yin-Yang Orb, special amulets, and her own spiritual power to fight more effectively. Sometime between Mystic Square and Embodiment of Scarlet Devil, she realized the ability to fly under her own jurisdiction. (Before then, she relied on Genjii, her turtle familiar, to fly.)Reimu is commonly described as easygoing, curious, dutiful, and optimistic — sometimes overly so. Her personality seems sympathetic toward many individuals; there are few characters who remain her rivals past the first encounter. Her shrine has become a moderately popular locale for some of Gensokyo's residents.","Th14Reimu.png"
2,2,1,"Marisa Kirisame","High-level Magic","Mid-teens","Magician, Kirisame Magic Shop owner, burglar, part-time youkai hunter","Marisa Kirisame is a human magician, and is one of the most important sub-characters of the series (according to series producer ZUN). Her personality is sometimes described as disagreeable, but in some other titles, straightforward. Either way, she is a very self-confident person that likes to stick her nose into every trouble out of curiosity.During the events of Story of Eastern Wonderland, she made her first appearance as a minion of Mima, to prevent Reimu from reaching her boss, but was defeated. Since then, she has appeared in all but one title of the Touhou series (and some non-Touhou titles too), usually sided with Reimu, but sometimes against her.She is also known as a hard worker, who's trying to catch up to Reimu with her secret training and magic development. That makes a good contrast to other humans appearing in the series, most of them have some kind of natural born talent (Reimu) or ability (Sakuya). So she is sometimes referred as the \"most human-ish human\" in the series.Marisa is the author of The Grimoire of Marisa, a collection of notes about spellcards used by her and other danmaku users she has encountered.","Th14Marisa.png"
3,3,2,"Cirno","Manipulating Ice (Glaciokinesis)","Implied to be over 60 years, though she is a child in youkai terms","Unknown","Cirno is an ice fairy. While she is described as a weak boss in the Touhou series, if we consider the power of average fairies - who appear often as regular enemies - we can certainly say she is exceptionally strong for her kind, and she is implied to be so in Phantasmagoria of Flower View by Eiki Shiki. Her personality is childish and rather incompetent, as you might expect from her appearance.\r\n\r\nDuring the events of Embodiment of Scarlet Devil, she attacked the player, who was just passing by, likely to test her strength.\r\n\r\nIn Perfect Cherry Blossom, she returned as the midboss of stage 1, presumably to challenge the player character again to prove her strength.\r\n\r\nIn Phantasmagoria of Flower View, Cirno aimlessly wandered about, apparently unconcerned by the flower incident for any reason other than the flowers being something else for her to freeze and play with.\r\n\r\nIn Hisoutensoku, Cirno was intrigued by what she believed to be the great Daidarabotchi and hoped to tame it so that she won't be afraid of anything anymore. She showed her intelligence by admitting that she is incapable of defeating the Daidarabotchi if it lives in the hot spring's boiler, since it is too hot for her.\r\n\r\nAfter the events of Strange and Bright Nature Deity, in Fairy Wars, Cirno tries to find those responsible for destroying their house. Learning that it was the Three Mischievous Fairies, she goes in search of those responsible, which she defeats easily though they all challenge her at once.\r\n\r\nAfter this &quot;incident\", Cirno wanders around for a while, bored of what she perceives as weak opponents. While wandering, she encounters Marisa Kirisame, making Cirno think she is a worthy opponent. They battle, and later, Marisa pauses and realizes that Cirno isn't as much of a pushover as the usual fairy, so she increases the power of her attacks.\r\n\r\nShe was last seen as a playable character in Hidden Star in Four Seasons, along with Reimu Hakurei, Marisa Kirisame and Aya Shameimaru.","240px-Th14Cirno.png"
4,4,4,"Patchouli Knowledge","Magic, especially good at Elemental Magic","100 years","Intellectual, librarian, teacher and scholar","Patchouli Knowledge is a very smart, asthmatic magician from the Scarlet Devil Mansion. Although she has only been a boss in one game, and playable character in three others, she is still a very popular character, showing up in many endings and is referenced quite often. She spends most of her time in the mansion's library reading and writing magic books. It seems that she's capable of very powerful magic of all kinds, using many elements in a single spell, but due to asthma and general poor health she's often unable to recite her spells.In Embodiment of Scarlet Devil, she attempts to stop the player from going further into the Scarlet Devil Mansion. In the extra stage, she tries again, and uses much more powerful magic, in part because she says she \"felt better that day\".She rarely leaves the Scarlet Devil Mansion, but in Immaterial and Missing Power, she makes an exception to go investigate the recent strange events. In other character's scenarios, she's visited by several of them, thinking that she, of all people, must know what the strange mist is. However, getting a straight answer from her is anything but easy. In Scarlet Weather Rhapsody, she decided to find what was the cause of the weather disaster. In the events of Subterranean Animism, she noticed the abnormalities in the underground, and had Marisa go with the help of Yukari preparing Marisa's options.During Silent Sinner in Blue, Patchouli constructed a rocket ship for the girls to fly to the moon.","PatchouliSWR.png"
5,4,1,"Sakuya Izayoi","Manipulation of Time, Manipulation of Space, Knife proficiency","Appears to be between 16-20 years old","Maid, Scarlet Devil Mansion Chief Maid","Easily one of the most enigmatic characters, despite appearing in so many games, Sakuya Izayoi is the Chief Maid at the Scarlet Devil Mansion. She works for her mistress, Remilia Scarlet, and is apparently the only human working at or living within the mansion. She has the power to manipulate time. She is known to then place knives in midair and resume time to allow these knives to fly towards her targets. Stopping time is also a handy way of doing large amounts of maid work in a short time. Because nearly everyone living or working at the mansion are maids, being the chief of them all means there are almost no people there with more authority within the mansion than Sakuya.During Embodiment of Scarlet Devil, Sakuya attempts to prevent the heroine from reaching her mistress, to whom she is very loyal, but fails.Later, during Perfect Cherry Blossom, Sakuya is able to show more of her true character, even if her main reason for trying to solve the problem is that the delayed Spring will affect her too.During the events of Scarlet Weather Rhapsody, she is initially commanded by Remilia to find possible suspects behind the strange weather. After Remilia grows tired of \"questioning\" suspects, she orders Sakuya to personally find and deal with the culprit. After doing so, Sakuya tells Reimu where to find the culprit, and later helps to rebuild the Hakurei Shrine after it is destroyed for the second time.","Th14Sakuya.png"

Though her appearance (and often behavior) is childlike, and seems nonthreatening, she has fearsome magical powers and a reputation to match, being known throughout Gensokyo as the dangerous \"Scarlet Devil.\" Like all vampires she is photosensitive and weakens when exposed to sunlight, so she typically remains inside her mansion (which has few windows to prevent light getting in) during the day and emerges during the night. While she is naturally known to drink human blood, her light appetite means her victims almost never die from their wounds.While her behavior is usually self-centered and somewhat bratty, it is possible to befriend her, however, humans and youkai alike prefer to avoid her. Her name, appearance, house, and clothing all indicate she is European in origin and emigrated to Japan many years ago (Her reason is unknown). She claims to be a descendant of the world's most notorious vampire, Count Vlad Tepes Dracul, but this is a bald-faced lie.","RemiliaSWR.png"
7,4,3,"Hong Meiling","Chinese Martial Arts, Manipulation of Qi","Unknown","Gatekeeper and Gardener of the Scarlet Devil Mansion","Hong Meiling is a youkai, though it isn't currently known which specific category she actually belongs to. She guards the entrance to the Scarlet Devil Mansion along with her henchmen. She is known for her mastery of the martial arts, part of which can be seen from her movement which is performed with Shin-Kyaku (a move in Chinese martial arts).During the events of Embodiment of Scarlet Devil, she tries to stop the heroine from entering the mansion, but fails. On Immaterial and Missing Power, she actually has no proper backstory and is only playable at arcade. However on Touhou Hisoutensoku, she is a playable character and the only one that encounters the Unnamed Giant Catfish, even though she never properly defeated it.During Unthinkable Natural Law, Meiling spotted a wandering giant and thought it was a Chinese god, \"Taisui Xinjun\".

Because of her unstable personality and incredibly destructive power, she lives in the basement of the Scarlet Devil Mansion. She's immune to Holy objects and has incredible physical strength.

She's a magician known primarily for her skillful use of dolls as well as being a loner. She gets in many fights with Marisa but they are somewhat acquaintances, sharing many of the same interests and even teaming up during Imperishable Night and Subterranean Animism.\r\n\r\nDuring Mystic Square, as a stage 3 boss, she attempted to prevent the heroine from proceeding. After the events she returns as the extra stage boss. Because Alice had learnt new types of magic from the grimoire, it is likely she became a youkai before the second encounter due to the high level magic. Nevertheless, she was still defeated. However, her dialogue with Reimu in stage 3 suggests that species changed before her appearance in the series.\r\n\r\nIn Immaterial and Missing Power the vast majority of her attacks involved dolls in one way or another, either attacking for her or being used as explosives. She is a doll specialist, but dolls are more like a hobby in comparison to her full power. Alice is always seen with a locked grimoire in her hands, which is thought to be the same &quot;Grimoire of Alice\" that she fought the protagonist with as the Mystic Square Extra Boss.\r\n\r\nBecause Alice, unlike Marisa, is much more interested in strategy and hates having to win a fight from sheer overwhelming power, she always holds back even if it means losing.\r\n\r\nIn Unthinkable Natural Law she creates a giant doll and tests it in battle against Cirno at the end of the latter's Story Mode. Later, her Giant Doll became an urban legend.","310px-Swr_alice.png"

2007,4004,3005,"Youmu Konpaku","Swordfighting, concentration, superhuman speed(?)","Unknown, but less than 60 years old","Gardener, Sword Instructor","Youmu Konpaku is one of the stranger entities in Gensokyo, part-human and part-phantom at the same time. Her two halves are not intermixed like one would expect from a cross-breed, but actually exist in physically separate bodies. Youmu has a straightforward and focused personality, which complements her swordfighting skills well. However, her personality conflicts with that of her master, Yuyuko Saigyouji, who is very whimsical and playful in nature. Still, she serves Yuyuko as best as she can, tending to the gardens in Hakugyokurou and following her orders.Youmu commonly wields two blades at once, having studied some under her predecessor, Youki. The longer blade, called 楼観剣 (Roukanken) - Lookout-Tower Sword, is said to be able to kill ten ghosts in one swipe. The shorter blade, 白楼剣 (Hakurouken) - White Tower Sword, is able to cleave through a person's own confusion. However, not much is known about her particular style of swordfighting or about her parents. What is known is that Youki, also a servant of Hakugyokurou, had begun training a very young Youmu (possibly as a child?) when he suddenly disappeared one day, leaving her style incomplete (and presumably causing her to teach herself). No one currently knows his whereabouts.During the events of Perfect Cherry Blossom, Youmu was ordered by Yuyuko to gather as much spring essence from Gensokyo as she could in order to get the entire cherry blossom garden, including the legendary Saigyou Ayakashi, to bloom perfectly. Youmu's efforts indirectly caused winter to continue unchecked in Gensokyo, prompting the player to find the source of the problem. Youmu tried to prevent the player from reaching Hakugyokurou but was defeated. She also tried to stop the player's confrontation against Yuyuko but was defeated again. In Imperishable Night, she traveled to the world of the living with the intent to fix the moon--although Yuyuko was more interested in having a feasting tour with a \"dragon dish\" as the crowning attraction. In Phantasmagoria of Flower View, she was minding her own business but kept encountering various people barging into Hakugyokurou suspecting her of being behind the flower incident. When she traveled to Gensokyo herself to behold the spectacle, she immediately noticed what was going on but thought nothing of it. During the events of Scarlet Weather Rhapsody, she set off to investigate, concerned as to how and why someone was slaying ghosts. After a hint from Yukari, she found and defeated the culprit.","270px-YoumuTD3.png"
2008,4004,3003,"Yuyuko Saigyouji ","Manipulation of Death, Ability to control departed souls","Dead/Immortal (Existed for at least 1000 years)","Ghost princess","Yuyuko Saigyouji is the ghost princess of Hakugyokurou, the netherworld of the \"formerly-living\", but was once a living human. Long ago, after her death from suicide, her body was used to place a seal on the Saigyou Ayakashi, a dangerous youkai cherry tree, to stop it from killing innocent humans. She has the power to invite mortal souls to death, and those souls who perish this way wind up in Hakugyokurou rather than Heaven or Hell. Though it might seem dangerous for such a whimsical, seemingly impulsive personality to wield such a terrible power, Yuyuko appears to have a strong sense of responsibility regarding her power, and never uses it recklessly or out of spite, nor does she use it as a weapon. Ironically, it was this power that drove her to kill herself in the first place. Humans fear Yuyuko because of her fearsome power and a general fear of the supernatural, but she is very cheerful and friendly. Unlike many ghosts, she resembles a living human, and her playful, good-humored personality, otherworldly beauty, and courtesan charm can have a disarming effect. She often makes bizarre and apparently nonsensical remarks and sometimes seems to overlook the obvious, leading to her characterization as an airhead or a ditz. However, at other times, she will reveal an extremely cunning and perceptive side and will also sometimes display an extraordinary level of knowledge. She seems to never take anything too seriously, though, and she loves to tease her straight-laced and eager-to-please assistant, Youmu, who is her opposite in many ways. Probably originating from the term \"hungry ghost\", she is also known for her incredible appetite and seems to have a food-related metaphor for any situation. Yuyuko is truly \"dead and loving it.\"","Yuyuko_-_Ten_Desires.png"

Because she is actually a fox that became a youkai (Kitsune) and is a shikigami herself it's highly unusual that Ran has a shikigami of her own. Having nine tails, the highest number of tails a kitsune ever has, is a clear sign of Ran's power and experience. Since kitsunes are said in many stories to grow an extra tail every hundred years to a maximum of nine, it's thought that Ran may be 900 years old. Even though Ran looks similar to a human and has more than enough intelligence to speak she is still essentially an animal and is often regarded as such by other characters.","225px-Ran.png"

She was first introduced in Perfect Cherry Blossom as the sleepy mistress of Ran Yakumo. During Imperishable Night, Yukari teams up with Reimu to find those responsible for the fake moon. In Immaterial and Missing Power, she actually sings her way from battle to battle, stealing everyone's sake, wine, and brandy. Even right from the shrine's altar... however, this is all part of her strategy to save the day. Somehow.Over a thousand years ago, Yukari organized an army of youkai and led them in an invasion of the Moon. The youkai were subsequently routed by the Lunarians, who possessed superior technology and magic, and forced to retreat to Earth. Since that time, no youkai have attempted to expand their territory beyond Gensokyo. While some speculate that Yukari organized the invasion out of selfish hunger for territory and power, others believe she did it to teach the youkai a lesson about starting wars of conquest; namely, that it was a bad idea.About a thousand years ago, Yukari met and became friends with a human girl named Yuyuko. After Yuyuko died, Yukari continued to be friends with Yuyuko's ghost, although Yuyuko gradually forgot who she had been and why she had died. When Yuyuko requested that Yukari use her power to weaken the border between the Netherworld and Gensokyo, Yukari obliged. She knew Yuyuko's plan to make the Saigyou Ayakashi bloom could never succeed, but was too busy sleeping to say or do anything about it, or to put the border back to normal after everything was finished, which put her on a collision course with the heroines.Yukari is known for being a very youkai-like youkai who sleeps all day and lives for the enjoyment of life. Though she rarely leaves her house, she's well-connected and is acquainted with most of the most powerful youkai (such as Suika and Yuyuko) as well as anyone having anything to do with the Hakurei border or outside world (Reimu and Rinnosuke). She's possibly the most powerful youkai in Gensokyo, and has a tendency to toy with her opponents rather than use her full power from the start. If anyone is suited for the role of \"mastermind\", it's Yukari; she often has a great deal of insight and understanding about whatever happens in Gensokyo, and possesses considerable intellectual prowess as well. Though she seems flaky and unreliable most of the time, when the safety or security of Gensokyo is at stake, she won't hesitate to get involved, even if it means using others to do the work for her. For example, in Scarlet Weather Rhapsody, she treats Tenshi Hinanawi with much hostility after finding out the plot of the Heavens. She could easily be either a villain or a heroine, depending on her whims.","310px-YukariP.png"

She is indeed feared by the locals as people around her become blinded by darkness.During the events of Phantasmagoria of Flower View, Mystia aimlessly wanders around singing, hoping to catch and eat humans attracted by the flowers.

She can't touch it, so she can't take it off.In the events of Embodiment of Scarlet Devil, she's attacked by the heroines for no reason (probably just as a general warmup), and has nothing to do with the main story.According to comments about her in the Bunbunmaru Newspaper and in Perfect Memento it seems that she's constantly surrounded by a mass/blob of darkness at all times except during the new moon, and so is rarely actually seen in person.

Making her way to Gensokyo she was surprised to meet the notorious fugitives Kaguya and Eirin, and asked for asylum in Eientei. In exchange, she works for and protects Kaguya and Eirin.During Imperishable Night Reisen hid within Eientei to avoid any lunar emissaries that might arrive on Earth and force her to return to the Moon. She was tasked with sealing the doors inside Eientei to ensure that Kaguya could not be found by the emissaries either. She used her power of insanity to stop the heroines from invading Eientei, but was defeated. Reisen's power of insanity comes from her eyes; she uses them to refract and twist waves, disorienting and confusing her victims and deceiving them with frightening illusions.Perhaps ironically given her insanity-inducing powers, Reisen seems to have one of the more stable and balanced personalities in Gensokyo. In Phantasmagoria of Flower View she worries about Tewi running off and seems more level headed than most other characters. Although she doesn't know what's causing the flower incident, she's decided to investigate by going wherever the flowers are blooming.During the events in Scarlet Weather Rhapsody she appears in the Scarlet Devil Mansion to ask questions but is beaten by the furious Mistress. Later she inquires into the fate of the Hakurei Shrine and asks if the earthquakes are still going on. Failing to find clues, she later goes to Hakugyokurou to check its condition and to ask Yuyuko about the Shrine's destruction. She tells her about the \"completion ceremony\" of the new shrine, but when she goes there, the shrine is destroyed. She also meets Yukari, who forbids her to investigate the shrine.

The second was to retrieve a jewelled branch from the island of Mount Hourai. The third was to seek the legendary robe of the fire-rat of China. The fourth was to retrieve a colored jewel from a dragon's neck. The final task was to find the legendary Cowry treasure of the swallows. These potent treasures were eventually revealed to already be in Kaguya's possession in the final stage of Imperishable Night.After years of exile, powerful emissaries arrived from the Moon; Kaguya had been forgiven of her crime and it had been decided that she should return. Kaguya, however, had grown to love life on Earth and had no desire to return to the lunar capital permanently. Enlisting the help of her friend Eirin, Kaguya escaped from the emissaries and fled to Gensokyo. Taking refuge in an ancient manor called Eientei hidden deep within a secluded bamboo forest, the two Lunarians began a new exile. After several centuries of isolation, she was eventually reunited with Mokou, who had also used the Hourai Elixir to become immortal, and the two continued their feud, murdering each other on a nearly daily basis.She now spends her days living in Eientei in a carefree manner, sometimes holding exhibitions of Lunarian treasures there for the rest of Gensokyo to admire. Her long isolation has made her lonely, and she enjoys telling stories to any guests she might receive.","Kaguya003.png"

Even though it has been over a thousand years since that happened, she continues to detest Kaguya, knowing full well that she can never get her revenge--nor can Kaguya ever put a permanent end to her. When not fighting with Kaguya though, she aids the nearby villagers by exterminating youkai and will even guide them safely to Eientei for medical treatment.
