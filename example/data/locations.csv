1,"Hakurei Shrine","The Hakurei Shrine (博麗神社, Hakurei Jinja) is a small, run-down Shinto shrine (神社) that lies in the mountains of the East, isolated from society. It exists on the boundary between this world and Gensokyo. It is simultaneously accessible from both sides, but some unknown circumstances must be met in order to travel from one side to the other.\n\nThe shrine is home to Reimu Hakurei. It's also apparently a popular hangout for all the other girls who Reimu and company defeat in the course of the Touhou games. Behind the shrine is a grove of cherry trees, which is a popular spot for flower viewing in spring.\n\nVery few humans come to this shrine, and even fewer (if anyone at all) leave donations. It has been around for many generations, thirteen at the very least. Because the shrine is old-fashioned, it offers poor protection from the cold. It was thought that the Hakurei Shrine was the only shrine in Gensokyo, but recently the Moriya Shrine has appeared as well. In Reimu's Scenario during the events of Scarlet Weather Rhapsody, it was destroyed by an earthquake caused by Tenshi Hinanawi, and again by Yukari Yakumo, but it was rebuilt with the help of Sakuya Izayoi, Alice Margatroid, and Suika Ibuki."
2,"Forest of Magic","The Forest of Magic (Mahou no Mori, 魔法の森) is a focal point for all things evil, ominous, and repulsive. It's a place whose true nature is clouded by strange rumours and weird happenstance. Once you look beyond the human-eating plants and inevitable, horrible misfortune that will surely befall all who even think of trespassing into the forest, it's also a fairly nice place to live for people who don't like to be disturbed.\r\n\r\nMarisa's house, where she keeps the many items she borrows, is located in the forest. She also runs the Kirisame Magic Shop from this location. Alice's house of dolls is also there. Near both of their houses is the tree where the Three Mischievous Fairies live. Rounding out the main attractions is Kourindou, Rinnosuke's shop of odds and ends (including many objects from the outside world), which is found on the very border of the forest itself."
3,"Misty Lake","The Misty Lake (霧の湖, Kiri no Mizūmi) is a large lake located at the foot of the Youkai Mountain. It surrounds a small island which hosts the Scarlet Devil Mansion. It seems to be a home to Cirno and other fairies, such as Daiyousei.\r\n\r\nThe river streaming into the lake is from the Youkai Mountain, and the mist around it makes it difficult to see through at noon. In the games, it was rather common to see up until Mountain of Faith, and was absent for 4 games, until Touhou Hisoutensoku was released. Embodiment of Scarlet Devil's Stage 2, some of Phantasmagoria of Flower View's Stages 1 and 2, and the whole Level 2 of Shoot the Bullet took place somewhere within the lake's area. In Touhou Hisoutensoku, Sanae's and Cirno's Stage 1 took place right by the lake edge.\r\n\r\nAlso the first stage of Double Dealing Character and the stages of the First Day of Impossible Spell Card are held in Misty Lake as well."
4,"Scarlet Devil Mansion","The Scarlet Devil Mansion (紅魔館, Koumakan lit. Scarlet Mansion or Scarlet Manor) is the Scarlet family's fancy European-style mansion. It is located on a ridge at the edge Misty Lake. It has relatively few windows for a building its size, which is a beneficial feature, considering the nature of its main tenants, Remilia and Flandre Scarlet (they happen to be vampires). In addition to the vampire sisters, the mansion also houses a large staff working under the Scarlet name. The most powerful staff members are Hong Meiling, who leads the outer guard; Patchouli Knowledge who acts as the librarian and private tutor; and Sakuya Izayoi, who is the maids' leader and acts as Remilia's personal attendant.\r\n\r\nThe inside of Scarlet Devil Mansion is much larger than is apparent from the outside. This is due to Sakuya's ability to manipulate time and space.\r\n\r\nScarlet Devil Mansion was the location of the majority of Embodiment of Scarlet Devil; Stage 4 took place in the library, Stage 5 and the Extra Stage took place in its hallways, and the Final Stage took place on the rooftop balcony."
4003,"Poltergeist Mansion","The Poltergeist Mansion (Sōreiyashiki, 騒霊屋敷) is home to the Prismriver Sisters. It was formerly the mansion of a human aristocrat in the outer world, but was transported into Gensokyo by the invocation of an unknown ritual.\r\n\r\nAlthough the poltergeists that reside within are clearly not alive, the mansion seems to exist outside of the Netherworld.\r\n\r\nNot much is known about the mansion itself beyond the fact that its inhabitants are noisy and that its precincts are probably dangerous to mentally unprepared visitors."
4004,"Hakugyokurou","Hakugyokurou (白玉楼, literally Tower of White Jade) is a ghost shrine overlooking the netherworld. It is well known among the afterlife realms for its cherry blossom gardens, and many ghosts come to see them every spring.\r\n\r\nThe term Hakugyokurou comes from Chinese legends of the Tang Dynasty (唐朝). It was said to be the place where artists go after death. Li He (李賀), a poet in those days, heard a voice in a dream he had as he was dying; the voice said, &quot;Hakugyokurou has been completely built, so come and write down its details.\" The story is the beginning of Hakugyokurou.\r\n\r\nYuyuko Saigyouji is the lady of Hakugyokurou, and Youmu Konpaku acts as its gardener. The massive youkai cherry tree, the Saigyou Ayakashi, can also be found lying dormant in the gardens of Hakugyokurou.\r\n\r\nHakugyokurou was the location for the final stage of Perfect Cherry Blossom and several fights in Immaterial and Missing Power and Scarlet Weather Rhapsody."
4005,"Human village","The Human Village (人里, Hitozato) is where most of Gensokyo's humans live. Even though some youkai also visit here to shop, this is the safest place in all of Gensokyo to live. Humans from the outside world that stumble into Gensokyo and decide to stay often have no choice but to live here as they would be unable to handle the youkai outside the village. The village itself has a powerful protector in Keine Kamishirasawa, who is capable of &quot;hiding\" the history of the village's existence so that youkai cannot even reach the village, much less attack it.\r\n\r\nAmong the people living at the village are Keine Kamishirasawa (who runs a school here) and Hieda no Akyu. The village has an as of yet unnamed leader, a florist, a tofu shop, etc. There's also the Kirisame-ya second-hand shop here which is owned by Marisa Kirisame's family.\r\n\r\nReisen Udongein Inaba is known to come here to sell medicine, and Sakuya Izayoi comes to shop. Most of the furniture in Scarlet Devil Mansion was made by humans in this village.\r\n\r\nAfter the Palanquin Ship landed near the village at the conclusion of Undefined Fantastic Object, Byakuren Hijiri converted it into a Buddhist temple."
4006,"Eientei","Eientei (永遠亭, literally House of Eternity) is the name of a large, old-fashioned Japanese mansion hidden deep within the Bamboo Forest of the Lost. It has hallways that lead out into the far reaches of the sky.\r\n\r\nEientei is currently occupied by a large group. Kaguya Houraisan and Eirin Yagokoro have been hiding there since their exile from the Moon. Other occupants include rabbits—lots of them—all under the command of Tewi Inaba and Reisen Udongein Inaba, who protect Kaguya and Eirin from intruders.\r\n\r\nEvery month on the night of the full moon, the residents of Eientei hold a Moon Festival (例月祭, Reigetsusai) offering mochi with medicinal herbs pounded into them. Making mochi is thus the main occupation of the Earth rabbits."
4007,"Bamboo Forest of the Lost","The Bamboo Forest of the Lost (Mayoi no Chikurin, 迷いの竹林) is said to be located in the opposite direction as the Youkai Mountain when looking out from the Human Village. The forest is featured as stages in Imperishable Night, Phantasmagoria of Flower View and Scarlet Weather Rhapsody. Inside of it lies the mansion Eientei.\r\n\r\nMokou lives here assisting any people who get lost, while Tewi and other rabbits can be seen wandering in the forest."
5005,"Youkai Mountain","Youkai Mountain (Youkai no Yama, 妖怪の山) is reputedly the greatest mountain in Gensokyo. At the base of it live the Kappa, such as Nitori Kawashiro, and at the top are the Tengu. It's actually such a dangerous place full of youkai, some of which don't like humans, that humans are normally unable to come here.\r\n\r\nThis mountain is protected by the white wolf tengu, such as Momiji Inubashiri, who patrol it. Also among the tengu living here is Aya Shameimaru, as well as other newspaper-writing tengu. The tengu chief is Lord Tenma.\r\n\r\nLately a new arrival from the outside world, the Moriya Shrine, has appeared on the mountain along with a lake. Sanae Kochiya, Kanako Yasaka, and Suwako Moriya all live at or near here. Both the kappa and tengu have come to accept Kanako as a resident god and now live in peace.\r\n\r\nAccording to Perfect Memento, Suika Ibuki can also be found here.\r\n\r\nRevealed by chapter four of Cage in Lunatic Runagate to be the Yatsugatake mountain range from the distant past, giving the only indication as to the real-world location of Gensokyo."
5006,"Nameless Hill","Nameless Hill (無名の丘) is a field full of lilies-of-the-valley on a mountain opposite Youkai Mountain. This location was used as a place to abandon children who had either died due to the poison of the lilies or those who were adopted by youkai. It is believed that this is where Medicine Melancholy was &quot;born\".\r\n\r\nThe Nameless Hill is Medince's stage in Phantasmagoria of Flower View."
5008,"Sanzu River","The Sanzu River (三途の川, Sanzu no Kawa; literally &quot;River of Three Crossings\") is the mist-shrouded river that dead souls must cross in order to reach Higan, where they will await judgment. Part of the riverbank is accessible from Gensokyo, even though the river's source, mouth and opposite bank lie outside it. Only the dead can cross the river on a shinigami's boat if they can afford to pay; everything except shinigami and their boats will sink.\r\n\r\nKomachi Onozuka may be seen ferrying souls here when she isn't slacking off. In Japanese Buddhist tradition, the Sanzu is said to have three crossings which vary in perilousness depending on the amount of sin a soul committed during his or her lifetime (hence the name). However, this concept is not used in Touhou: instead, Komachi uses her power of distance manipulation to vary the width of the river according to the souls' sinfulness."
5009,"Hell","The Hell (地獄, Jigoku) is a location in Gensokyo. It is where the Hell Route in Highly Responsive to Prayers occurred, along with the Subterranean Animism stages 3-6. It is shown that the Silent Shrine where Konngara resides is here, along with the Underground Geyser Center, Ancient City, Palace of the Earth Spirits, and the Hell of Blazing Fires.\r\n\r\nKikuri appears to also reside here in an unknown location, as also shown in Highly Responsive to Prayers. Utsuho Reiuji maintains the heat of Hell, whilst Rin Kaenbyou carries corpses to the former Hell of Blazing Fires to regulate its heat."
6006,"Moriya Shrine","The Moriya Shrine (Moriya Jinja, 守矢神社) originated from the outside world and was transported into Gensokyo by Kanako Yasaka during the start of the events of Mountain of Faith. The shrine is now located somewhere near the top of Youkai Mountain by a lake that was also transported with it. As noted in Silent Sinner in Blue, a distinctively thick shimenawa is hung across the entrance of the shrine building, bigger than the one at the Hakurei Shrine. (As an aside, we can see the same design at Suwa Grand Shrine, the original inspiration of Moriya Shrine. The real-world Moriya Shrine—with a different kanji, 洩矢神社—also exists near the Suwa Grand Shrine.)\r\n\r\nThis shrine is home to Sanae Kochiya, whose role is similar to a Shrine Maiden, and its resident gods Kanako Yasaka and Suwako Moriya."
7005,"Underworld","..."
7007,"The Remains of the Blazing Hell","The Hell of Blazing Fires', or more accurately, the Remains of the Blazing Hell (Shakunetsu Jigoku Ato, 灼熱地獄跡) is located below the Palace of the Earth Spirits. It is where Stage 6 of Subterranean Animism occurs. Formerly a part of the underground Hell where criminals were banished, it has recently been re-ignited by Utsuho Reiuji and is now being utilized by the Kappa of Youkai Mountain as part of their Mountain Industrial Revolution project."
7008,"Palace of the Earth Spirits","The Palace of the Earth Spirits (地霊殿, Chireiden) is where the heroines visit in Stage 4 of Subterranean Animism. &quot;Chireiden\" is also the Japanese title of the game.\r\n\r\nIt is a Western-style mansion with many stained glass windows on the wall placed above the Hell of Blazing Fires. It said that the Palace was constructed after the underground was separated from Hell, thus many evil spirits remain in what was the former Hell.\r\n\r\nSatori took control of the Palace and managed it by herself with the help of her pets, keeping it relatively peaceful. Of her pets, Rin's duty is to carry corpses to the Hell of Blazing Fires for the heating of the place and Utsuho is to maintain that heat. The other pets' duties were said to be tending the garden and playing with Satori's sister, Koishi."
7009,"Ancient City","The Ancient City (Kyuuto or Kyuu Miyako, 旧都) is a large village in Hell, first seen in Subterranean Animism. It is situated between the bridge to Hell, guarded by Parsee, and the Palace of the Earth Spirits, where Satori and Koishi live. The buildings appear to be modeled after traditional Japanese houses, and the streets appear to be lit with fiery hanging lanterns. Although the city is built underground, it is still able to receive snowfall.\r\n\r\nThe Ancient City is populated primarily by oni, who moved underground long ago in order to avoid humans. Many oni, such as Yuugi Hoshiguma, can easily be found partying in the streets here. Suika Ibuki most likely lived here before moving to Gensokyo. Aside from the oni, many other subterranean youkai can probably be found here on occassions, as Yamame Kurodani mentions that the city doesn't turn away visitors."
8005,"Palanquin Ship","The Palanquin Ship (聖輦船, Seirensen lit. Star-Lotus Ship) was created by Byakuren Hijiri and is captained by Minamitsu Murasa. The ship is able to sail through the sky and even reach Makai. Her crew consists of youkai, notable members being Shou Toramaru, Ichirin Kumoi and Nazrin. Although both Reimu Hakurei and Marisa Kirisame call it a &quot;Flying Treasure Ship\", once on board, they find the ship is empty.\r\n\r\nByakuren made it as a recreation of the ship from which Murasa had fallen overboard, allowing her to no longer be bound to the ocean in which she had drowned.\r\n\r\nThe ship had been buried underground when Byakuren was sealed away by humans, but was brought back up to the surface by a geyser caused by Utsuho during the events of Subterranean Animism.\r\n\r\nAfter the events of Undefined Fantastic Object, the ship landed near the Human Village, and was turned temporarily into a granary, before being later on renovated into a temple named Myouren Temple (Myōrenji, 命蓮寺). It is named after Byakuren's brother, Myouren Hijiri. The temple is quite popular to humans and youkai alike as of now.\r\n\r\nThe inspiration for the Palanquin Ship is the Flying Storage (Tobi Kura, 飛倉) which appears in the first volume of Shigi san Engi Emaki: Myouren made a bowl fly, so it was called the Flying Bowl (Hihatsu, 飛鉢), for people to place offerings into. When a certain rich man suspected that Myouren might be skimming off the top, he shut the bowl into a closed storage room. In return, Myouren made the whole storage room fly, along with the bowl and the other stored supplies like bales of rice. The rich man asked Myouren to give back the supplies so he did. After a long time, perhaps after long time passed since Myouren died, the Flying Storage fell into ruin, but it gained sacred power from his cloth which his sister gave to him. People wondered about it, so they removed pieces of it from the Storage.\r\n\r\nThe temple was landed directly above the Dream Palace Great Mausoleum, where Miko suspended animation. Byakuren kept a close eye on Miko and other Buddhist monks kept placing seals on her mausoleum. Nue called Mamizou into Gensokyo to fight against Miko. During Ten Desires, Yoshika Miyako was guarding the door leading to the Dream Palace Great Mausoleum under the order of Seiga Kaku.\r\n\r\nNue Houjuu and Mamizou Futatsuiwa currently live in the Myouren Temple."
9005,"Dream Palace Great Mausoleum","The Dream Palace Great Mausoleum (Yumedonodaishibyō, 夢殿大祀廟) is a mausoleum that is straight under the Myouren Temple. The Dream Palace Great Mausoleum has many ghosts and spirits, including Soga no Tojiko. The fourth, fifth and sixth stage of Ten Desires takes place at the Dream Palace Great Mausoleum.\r\n\r\nToyosatomimi no Miko's mausoleum is located in there. Seiga Kaku and Mononobe no Futo were at the Dream Palace Great Mausoleum during Ten Desires.\r\n\r\nMany years ago, Toyosatomimi no Miko attempted to gain an immortal body through going into a sleep that looked like she died, but in reality, her body would not decompose. However, scared to undergo the process, she asked Mononobe no Futo to try the process first. Since it was successful, Toyosatomimi no Miko also went to sleep. Soga no Tojiko also joined, but could only be resurrected as a ghost. After the events of Undefined Fantastic Object and before Ten Desires, the Palanquin Ship landed on top of the mausoleum. This was planned, however, as Byakuren Hijiri and Toyosatomimi no Miko were religious rivals. Later, the ship was rebuilt into a temple. Although Byakuren attempted to stop Miko's resurrection through using Buddhist seals, Ten Desires occurs when Miko finally is able to resurrect in the mausoleum."
12005,"Heaven","In Touhou, Heaven (天界,Tenkai lit. Celestial World) is a collection of separate realms existing above the Earth. One of them, Bhava-Agra, is the setting of most final battles in Scarlet Weather Rhapsody, and can be reached by climbing the Youkai Mountain. Bhava-Agra is also where Tenshi Hinanawi and her family live. Suika Ibuki may occasionally be seen there as well.\r\n\r\nCelestials, Angels, and other heavenly beings reside there. These residents generally live carefree lives filled with fishing, song, dance, sake, and peaches. They may also find enjoyment in viewing events that unfold on the Earth."
12006,"Shining Needle Castle","The Shining Needle Castle (輝針城 Kishinjou) is a castle that's located in the skies above Gensokyo in an &quot;entirely-inverted world\". It takes place in the last 2 stages of Double Dealing Character."
12020,"Mayohiga","The original source of Mayohiga (マヨヒガ or 迷ひ家) appears to be from &quot;Tohno Monogatari\" (The Story of the Tohno region), a collection of folk stories by Kunio Yanagida, the founding father of Japanese folklore. This strange story is mainly told in the northeast of Japan. The name of the story is sometimes written as Mayoiga (マヨイガ or 迷い家), meaning \"stray house.\" The tale is about a strange house that people wandering into another world are supposed to reach.\r\n\r\nMayohiga might be the home of Yukari Yakumo and is actually located on the Gensokyo boundary, similar to the Hakurei Shrine. However, while the Hakurei Shrine is physically there on both sides of the boundary, Mayohiga acts as the rest of the boundary separating Gensokyo from the real world. Travelers who journey near the boundary will start to become disoriented and lost, and if they persist onward will find themselves spirited away to the almost dreamlike village of Mayohiga."
12021,"Netherworld","The Netherworld (Meikai, lit. Gloomy World, 冥界) is the land where ghosts reside after death. Apparently it's a distinct part of Gensokyo, but is separated from the Land of the Living by a strong barrier (one even Marisa couldn't breach with her raw power).\r\n\r\nThe barrier is situated at a great gate high above the clouds. Unfortunately, like most barriers in Gensokyo, this barrier is rather vague, and, while it's powerful enough to keep people from passing directly through, there's nothing preventing people from flying over it. Thus, the Border between Death and Life is quite thin. Depending on the scenario, the barrier was either taken down by Reimu (Reimu's story), flown over (Marisa's story) or simply bypassed (Sakuya's story).\r\n\r\nDuring the events of Perfect Cherry Blossom, the barrier was weakened by Yukari Yakumo and had to be repaired by her afterwards. Apparently, she never got around to repairing it, as the boundary continues to thin in the summer of Imperishable Night."
12022,"Garden of the Sun","The Garden of the Sun (太陽の畑) is a field full of sunflowers that is home to numerous fairies and youkai, including Yuuka Kazami. There are a few battles in Phantasmagoria of Flower View that take place here; most of which involving a battle with Yuuka.\r\n\r\nIt's located behind a mountain not too far from the Human Village."
12023,"Genbu Marsh","Genbu Marsh (玄武の沢) is a marsh named after the legendary tortoise Genbu (玄武). This marsh, consisting of a six-sided rock formation surrounded by mountains, was created while Youkai Mountain was still an active volcano. It's located near the Forest of Magic and Youkai Mountain.\r\n\r\nIn Symposium of Post-mysticism it is said that this is where many kappa live, including Nitori Kawashiro. Furthermore, in chapter 4 of Cage in Lunatic Runagate the Genbu Marsh is mentioned on several occasions as well as a location in Strange and Bright Nature Deity."
12024,"Great Youkai Forest","The Great Youkai Forest (Youkai no Jukai, 妖怪の樹海) was said to be found at the Youkai Mountain. Hina Kagiyama is one of the youkai who live here. The forest is very dark and there's no sunlight seen in the forest. The Great Youkai Forest was the location for the second stage in Mountain of Faith."
12025,"Makai","Makai (魔界) is the world of demons and basically means &quot;demonic realm\", \"world of spirits\", or \"hell\". However it is not to be confused with Jigoku which is also known as Hell, as such Demons' World might be a better English phrase for Makai. The entrance is located in a cave in the mountains near the Hakurei Shrine.\r\n\r\nThis is where the heroines first met Alice Margatroid, apparently before she lived in the Forest of Magic. It is ruled over by Shinki who created Makai.\r\n\r\nThis is where many events of Highly Responsive to Prayers occurred, as well as almost the entirety of Mystic Square and the last two stages of Undefined Fantastic Object.\r\n\r\nMakai is a land with a harsh and unearthly nature that makes it difficult to survive in, but youkai and some humans live and/or train their powers here regardless. It is filled with a toxic miasma which is physically harmful, but strengthens magical spells and seals, and can also make learning magic easier for a human.\r\n\r\nMuch of Makai's terrain is a deep red color, but there are also extensive fields of crystalline forests and frozen fields. This is especially true around Pandæmonium, Shinki's fortress, which seems to be constructed from a similar crystalline material.\r\n\r\nLong before the events of Undefined Fantastic Object, Byakuren Hijiri was sealed in a part of the Makai, the Hokkai. Byakuren believed Youkai and Human should co-exist, but humans disagreed and sealed her away. She was unsealed by Murasa and her team during Undefined Fantastic Object."
12026,"Myouren Temple Cemetery","The Myouren Temple Cemetery (命蓮寺墓地) is a cemetery, as its name suggest, found near the Myouren Temple. The cemetery is incredibly old and may have even been a part of the Dream Palace Great Mausoleum being built before or after it, seeing as its entrance is near the the cemetery. Of course, it seems as though the Myouren Temple has power over the cemetery now.\r\n\r\nThis area is full of gravestones, as one would expect. Yoshika Miyako appears during the heroines' journey, likely with other jiang shi. It's uncertain as to whether or not any of them are guarding the cemetery as Toyosatomimi no Miko is being resurrected. Kogasa Tatara seems to live here, or visit often, simply to scare people."
12027,"Muenzuka","Muenzuka (無縁塚), also known as &quot;Mound of the Nameless\", is a small wooded area located at the end of the Road of Reconsideration. It's a graveyard for humans who don't have any relatives or were from outside of Gensokyo. It is also home to a cherry blossom tree bearing purple cherry blossoms\r\n\r\nThis is where the final battle in Phantasmagoria of Flower View's story mode against Shikieiki Yamaxanadu takes place.\r\n\r\nThis location is named after a Japanese Buddhist term \"muen-botoke\" (無縁仏), meaning \"a dead person or soul lacking his/her relatives by blood and marriage who arrange his/her grave\"."
